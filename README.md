Implements a BFS to determine the most optimal route for a knight on a chessboard to move from A to B. Also has a UI for clicking to move with highlighted squares for valid/invalid moves and a picture of my cat as the chess piece.
The most optimal route is carried out with a 250ms delay between each move, so click on a red square and see the step-by-step process.
